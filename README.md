# Reciprocal Best Structure Hits
## Background
In this work, we are using AlphaFold structure models to find the closest homologues proteins between <i>Homo sapiens</i> and <i>D. melanogaster</i>, <i>C. elegans</i>, <i>S. cerevisiae</i> and <i>S. pombe</i> as well as between <i>S. cerevisiae</i> and <i>S. pombe</i>. </br>
